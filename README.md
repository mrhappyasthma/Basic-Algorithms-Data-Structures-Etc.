# Basic-Algorithms-Reference
A collection of various sorts, searches, and so forth for reference when studying for things like interviews.

My primary references are "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Algorithms" 4th Edition, and StackOverflow.com.

Most of these were written by hand and tested after the fact in preperation for interviews.  I re-tested most of them as I added them here, but they should be taken "as-is".  Please report and bugs or errors! :)
