# Interview Prep
A collection of various algorithms, data structures, and so forth for reference when studying for things like interviews.

My primary references are ["Cracking the Coding Interview"](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X), ["Algorithms" 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and www.StackOverflow.com.

*Note 1:  Most of these were written by hand and tested after the fact in preperation for interviews.  I re-tested most of them as I added them here, but they should be taken "as-is".  Please report any bugs or errors! :)

**Note 2:  Many of these are not complete java classes.  Some are just a single method.  Others are partially complete classes.  Some are complete, runnable classes w/ or w/out main()'s.  Make sure you check what you're dealing with before just trying to run the code by itself!
