# Basic-Algorithms-Reference
A collection of various algorithms, data structures, and so forth for reference when studying for things like interviews.

My primary references are ["Cracking the Coding Interview"](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X), ["Algorithms" 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), and www.StackOverflow.com.

Most of these were written by hand and tested after the fact in preperation for interviews.  I re-tested most of them as I added them here, but they should be taken "as-is".  Please report and bugs or errors! :)
